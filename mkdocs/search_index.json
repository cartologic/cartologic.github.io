Is it a replacement for GeoNode?\n\n\n\n\nCartoView is \nGeo App market\n for GeoNode. It is not a fork / improvement / reprlacement of Geonode, but rather additional code aimed at making it more extensible to integrate third party apps directly from the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the goals of Cartoview?\n\n\n\n\nSharing GIS Apps\n\n\nProvide apps for common tasks like visualizing and querying feature services.\n\n\nExtend the functions of the GeoNode SDI beyond data management\n\n\nProvide a solid core of utilities that can be used to help developers integrate and deploy their Geo apps \n\n\nFoster an ecosystem of apps extending easily deplyable and installable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I use CartoView with GeoNode Version 2.4 and earlier?\n\n\n\n\nCartoView starts working with GeoNode 2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have an idea! What should I do?\n\n\n\n\nPlease file an issue. \nIssues\n are a great way to discuss new ideas, build consensus and talk about implementation details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI built something with cartoview can I show you?\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! Share it on twitter with \n@ahmednosman\n , \n@cartoview\n. You can add your project to the list in the readme too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI built a reusable app  can I contribute it?\n\n\n\n\nOfcourse. This is the purpose of Cartoview. Read the instructions on developing and deploying apps. Create an account on cartoview.org and load your app. Your app will be immediately available to all Cartoview deployments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some good CartoView Apps?\n\n\n\n\nSimple Map Viewer\n : This app allows the creation of html mobile ready viewer app with most basic features.\n\n\nFeature Detailed Viewer\n : A map and list applications for store locations or similar usage\n\n\nWebApp Builder\n : A customizable GIS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning CartoView on GeoNode and QGIS Server?\n\n\n\n\nThere is no reason for Cartoview not to work on this deployment. (This was never tested). Apps relying on GeoServer ofcourse will not work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Requirements\n\n\n\n\nPython2\n\n\n1.8.7 \n= Django \n1.9a0\n\n\n\n\nInstall On Ubuntu linux\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow these setps if you don\nt have Geonode  installed on your ubuntu system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese instructions will install \nGeonode\n and Cartoview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnote :\n Verify your installation is completed by adding any layer in \nGeonode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n\n\n\n\n1.8.7 \n= Django \n1.9a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nGeonode=2.5.15\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall CartoView Libraries\n\n\n$ pip install cartoview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall CartoView_Django Project\n\n\n$django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/cartologic/cartoview-project-template/archive/master.zip \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to your Project Folder \n\n\n$cd \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetect changes in \napp_manager\n App\n\n\n$python manage.py makemigrations app_manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate people Table\n\n\n$python manage.py migrate people```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Rest of tables :\n\n\n$python manage.py migrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nload default User\n\n\n$python manage.py loaddata sample_admin.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nload default oauth app\n\n\n$python manage.py loaddata json/default_oauth_apps.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Server (Development)\n\n\n\n\nTo start Development Server run this Command :\npython manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Optional)\n if want to override any settings variable rename \nlocal_settings.py.sample\n to \nlocal_settings.py\n then override settings you want inside \nlocal_settings.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Don\nt Forget to Change \nyour_project_name\n to desired name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto Install apps from \nGeo App Market\n run this command \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad Default Store\n\n\n    $ python manage.py loaddata app_stores.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you Can Install Apps from \nGeo App Market\n \n\n\n\n\nGo to \napps\n tab and click \nmanage apps\n Button and install app you want\n\n\n\n\nInstall On Windows\n\n\nWe recommend to use Docker\n\n\n\n\nFollow \nDocker Instructions\n\n\n\n\nExisting GeoNode Users\n\n\nCheck GeoNode and Cartoview version compatibility in \nPYPI\n then install Cartoview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n\n\n\n\n GeoNode == 2.5.15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall cartoview libraries\n\n\n$ pip install cartoview == \nversion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Cartoview Project\n\n\n    $django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/cartologic/cartoview-project-template/archive/master.zip \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to your Project Folder \n\n\n$ cd \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndetect Changes in app_manager\n\n\n$python manage.py makemigrations app_manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py migrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py collectstatic --noinput\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Development Server :\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker\n\n\n\n\nbe sure you installed all \nrequirements\n\n\nInstall \nDocker\n\n\n\n\nCreate Cartoview Project using this command:\n\n\n    $django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/cartologic/cartoview-project-template/archive/master.zip \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nyour_project_name\n with desired name here i will use \ncartoview_project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to your project Folder \n\n\n\n\ncd \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to run this project on localhost only change two variables(project,module) in \nuwsgi.ini\n file :\n\n\n    project = \nyour_project_name\n\n    .....\n    module= \nyour_project_name\n.wsgi:application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to run this project with a domain :\n\n\n\n\nrepeat previous step\n\n\nchange \ndjango.env\n file to be some thing like this :\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://cartologic:root@postgis:5432/cartoview\nGEOSERVER_PUBLIC_LOCATION=http://\nyour_domain_or_ip\n/geoserver/\nGEOSERVER_LOCATION=http://geoserver:8080/geoserver/\nSITEURL=http://\nyour_domain_or_ip\n\nALLOWED_HOSTS=['*']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Docker images type :\n\n\n\n\nmake up\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndetect changes in \napp_manager\n App:\n\n\nmake prepare_manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate  people table : \n\n\nmake migrate_people\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate rest of  tabels : \n\n\nmake sync\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can Access cartoview on \nhttp://localhost\n or ```http://\n\n\nFinal step Configure Geoserver before uploading layers from \nhere\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nIf something isn\nt working the way you expected, please take a look at \nprevious issues\n that resolve common problems first.\n\n\nHave you found a new bug?
