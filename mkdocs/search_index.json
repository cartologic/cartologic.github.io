Is it a replacement for GeoNode?\n\n\n\n\nCartoView is \nGeo App market\n for GeoNode. It is not a fork / improvement / reprlacement of Geonode, but rather additional code aimed at making it more extensible to integrate third party apps directly from the browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the goals of Cartoview?\n\n\n\n\nSharing GIS Apps\n\n\nProvide apps for common tasks like visualizing and querying feature services.\n\n\nExtend the functions of the GeoNode SDI beyond data management\n\n\nProvide a solid core of utilities that can be used to help developers integrate and deploy their Geo apps \n\n\nFoster an ecosystem of apps extending easily deplyable and installable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I use CartoView with GeoNode Version 2.4 and earlier?\n\n\n\n\nCartoView starts working with GeoNode 2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have an idea! What should I do?\n\n\n\n\nPlease file an issue. \nIssues\n are a great way to discuss new ideas, build consensus and talk about implementation details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI built something with Esri cartoview cam I show you?\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely! Share it on twitter with \n@ahmednosman\n , \n@cartoview\n. You can add your project to the list in the readme too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI built a reusable app  can I contribute it?\n\n\n\n\nOfcourse. This is the purpose of Cartoview. Read the instructions on developing and deploying apps. Create an account on cartoview.org and load your app. Your app will be immediately available to all Cartoview deployments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some good CartoView Apps?\n\n\n\n\nSimple Map Viewer\n : This app allows the creation of html mobile ready viewer app with most basic features.\n\n\nFeature Detailed Viewer\n : A map and list applications for store locations or similar usage\n\n\nWebApp Builder\n : A customizable GIS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning CartoView on GeoNode and QGIS Server?\n\n\n\n\nThere is no reason for Cartoview not to work on this deployment. (This was never tested). Apps relying on GeoServer ofcourse will not work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall On Ubuntu linux\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n\n\n1.8.7 \n= Django \n1.9a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nGeonode == 2.5.15\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall CartoView Libraries\n\n\n$ pip install cartoview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall CartoView_Django Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/cartologic/cartoview-project-template/archive/master.zip  \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$cd \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$bower install\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py makemigrations app_manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py migrate people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py migrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py loaddata sample_admin.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py loaddata json/default_oauth_apps.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Server (Development)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start Development Server run this Command :\n\n\npython manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n Don\nt Forget to Change \nyour_project_name\n to desired name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall On Windows\n\n\nWe recommend to use Docker\n\n\n\n\nInstall Docker or Docker toolbox\n\n\nRun docker container to install geonode\n\n\nContinue as above\n\n\n\n\nExisting GeoNode Users\n\n\nCheck GeoNode and Cartoview version compatibility in \nPYPI\n then install Cartoview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n\n\n\n\n1.8.7 \n= Django \n1.9a0\n\n\n GeoNode == 2.5.15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ pip install cartoview == \nversion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/cartologic/cartoview-project-template/archive/master.zip  \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ cd \nyour_project_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ bower install\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py makemigrations app_manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py migrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py collectstatic --noinput\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Development Server :\n\n\n\n\n$python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nIf something isn\nt working the way you expected, please take a look at \nprevious issues\n that resolve common problems first.\n\n\nHave you found a new bug?
